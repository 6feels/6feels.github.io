<!-- Content -->
My name is Charles Vanchieri, I am 39 yrs old and I grew up in Silicon Valley California USA, I moved to Sydney Australia at the end of 2021 with my wife and 2 young children. My wife was born and raised in Sydney which has given me full working rights with an Australian Partner Visa. We have had a wonderful 2 years in Sydney and have made long-term plans to stay and raise our children here in this great area. 
<br>
<br>
For the last 5 years I have been working in project management and customer success roles for companies working out of the United States. Now that the family has made the decision to stay in Australia I am looking to transition to a company that is located here in Sydney.
<br>
<br>
With a strong background in management, leadership, and customer relations, I am seeking an opportunity where I can apply my valuable skills and extensive experience. I am confident that I can excel in customer success, management, and administration roles and would make valuable long-term contributions to the success of the company.
